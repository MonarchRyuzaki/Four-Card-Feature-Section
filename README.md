## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Actually, The main Design was pretty simple. The challenge was in making the layout responsive for various screen sizes. Here I followed the usual way, the way I used to do things(i.e, Desktop First). This made me realize that a lot of code is repeated and is probably not the best way. From next challenge onwards, I will be using the mobile First Workflow, and maybe redo this later

### Continued development

Get more Experience on Making Responsive Layouts and use the mobile first workflow from next time.
